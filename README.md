# Spring
This is a minimal config made for bspwm. I have included config files for bspwm, mpd, ncmpcpp and compton + the color scheme used in the screenshot.

## Information
This is just another config I made and I hope that someone can get any use of this. Feel free to steal this config and make something new from it!
